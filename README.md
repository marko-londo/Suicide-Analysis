# Suicide Data Analysis & Visualization

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of suicide rates and their correlation with various factors, culminating in an interactive Streamlit dashboard. The main objective of this project is to shine a light on this pressing public health issue and identify key determinants.

## Project Motivation

Suicide is a significant public health concern, claiming nearly 50,000 lives in the US in 2021. Through the exploration of this dataset, the primary aim was to understand the various factors that might lead someone to consider suicide, including geographic, societal, and economic dimensions. Initial findings indicate a notable correlation between suicide rates and economic distress.

The primary dataset, a global suicide database, was meticulously curated, emphasizing data pertinent to the United States. This data was complemented by information sourced from organizations such as the CDC, the 988 Suicide Lifeline, Kaggle, and more.

The subject of suicide has many facets, and while this project focused on certain aspects, many remain to be explored. Potential avenues for future investigation include veteran suicides and in-depth trends segmented by generations or locations.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**
  - **data_cleaning.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook detailing the data cleaning process. 
  - **suicides.ipynb**: Base visualizations offering a preliminary understanding of the data landscape.
- **Dashboard**: The main directory for the interactive Streamlit dashboard.
  - **Dashboard.py**: The primary script for the Streamlit app, which includes navigations to different pages, each highlighting various aspects of the data.
- **Resources**: Various data sources used in the project.

The Streamlit dashboard showcases a comprehensive exploration of suicide rates and associated factors, using visualizations crafted with Bokeh, HoloViews, and Plotly.
